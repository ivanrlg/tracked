# MTB Mate

An attempt to track stuff such as speed and jumps on a mountain bike using an android phone.

## Notes/Thoughts
- Attached phone to bike and went down jump track, results weren't great as the phone was big and the holder moved about too much. Maybe attach the phone in a better place? Or attach an accelerometer directly to the bike and send the data to the phone?
